== Goals

The existing project from the previous class is being adopted and further developed.
The goal is to enhance the functionality and usability of the system to make it effective for school operations.
Additionally, modern technologies will be integrated to ensure the project is future-proof and efficient.


== Latest Status

During the last sprint, we achieved the following milestones:

- **3D School Model**: Presentation creation and navigation system updates.
- **Smarthome System (Sensors)**: Calibration and documentation of sensors, along with MQTT server setup.
- **2D Model**: SVG rendering improvements and database setup for DXF import.
- **Sensor Assignment**: Drag-and-drop functionality for assigning sensors to rooms, with random data generation.
- **PV Dashboard**: Initial dashboard creation for energy monitoring.

These components are functional but require integration and testing to ensure seamless operation.

== Final outcome

At the end of the project, we will have a fully functional system that can be used in schools to monitor and manage energy consumption.
Additionally, we will try to develop the project enough to deploy it on the school website.
