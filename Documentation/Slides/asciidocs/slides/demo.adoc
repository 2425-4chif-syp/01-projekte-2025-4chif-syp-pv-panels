== Goals

The existing project from the previous class is being adopted and further developed.
The goal is to enhance the functionality and usability of the system to make it effective for school operations.
Additionally, modern technologies will be integrated to ensure the project is future-proof and efficient.


== Latest Status

- **3D Model**: Updated the old 3D model.
- **2D Model**: Improved the 2D model.
- **Sensor Dashboard**: Added drag-and-drop functionality for sensor assignment and implemented random data generation for test-sensors.
- **Threshold Button**: Added a threshold button for the sensor dashboard.

Note: Danis (no longer part of the team) worked on school navigation, but the feature remains incomplete.

== Final outcome

At the end of the project, we will have a fully functional system that can be used in schools to monitor and manage energy consumption.
Additionally, we will try to develop the project enough to deploy it on the school website.
