= Part1: Troubleshooting MQTT Connection


== Objective
The goal was to deploy a Quarkus application on a virtual machine (VM) and troubleshoot an issue where the application failed to connect to the MQTT servers despite working in IntelliJ locally.

== Steps Taken

=== 1. Initial Setup
1. The Quarkus application was developed and tested successfully in IntelliJ.
2. A runnable JAR file (`leoenergy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`) was created using Maven:
- Command: `./mvnw clean package`
3. The JAR file was copied to the VM using SCP:
- Command: `scp target/leoenergy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar leoeadmin@vm29.htl-leonding.ac.at:/home/leoeadmin/`

=== 2. Running the Application on the VM
1. The application was started on the VM:
- Command: `java -jar leoenergy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`
2. Observed logs showed connection timeouts when trying to reach the MQTT servers:
- `vm90.htl-leonding.ac.at:1883`
- `mqtt.htl-leonding.ac.at:8883`

=== 3. Troubleshooting
To address the issue, the following troubleshooting steps were performed:

==== A. Verifying Network Access
1. Network connectivity to the MQTT servers was tested using `ping`:
- `ping vm90.htl-leonding.ac.at`
- `ping mqtt.htl-leonding.ac.at`
2. Ports were checked using `telnet` and `nc`:
- `telnet vm90.htl-leonding.ac.at 1883`
- `telnet mqtt.htl-leonding.ac.at 8883`

==== B. TLS Configuration
1. The secure port `8883` required a TLS connection.
2. The connection was tested using OpenSSL:
- Command: `openssl s_client -connect mqtt.htl-leonding.ac.at:8883`

==== C. Application Configuration
1. The application’s `application.properties` file was reviewed to verify MQTT configurations (host, port, credentials).
2. The active profile (`prod` vs. `dev`) was analyzed:
- IntelliJ used `dev` profile with live coding enabled.
- On the VM, the `prod` profile was active.

==== D. Manual MQTT Tests
1. MQTT connectivity was tested manually using `mosquitto-clients`:
- Command: `mosquitto_sub -h mqtt.htl-leonding.ac.at -p 8883 -t "your/topic"`

==== E. Reproducing Locally
1. The JAR file was run locally outside IntelliJ to ensure it behaved identically:
- Command: `java -jar target/leoenergy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`

=== 4. Results
After troubleshooting:
1. The application successfully connected to the MQTT servers when running locally in IntelliJ.
2. However, the output differed when running on the VM, potentially due to:
- Differences in environment, such as network restrictions or profile settings.
- Missing dependencies or certificates.

== Next Steps
1. Verify the VM’s network access to the MQTT servers and adjust firewall rules if necessary.
2. Ensure TLS certificates for secure connections are configured correctly on the VM.
3. Compare the `prod` and `dev` profile configurations for discrepancies.
4. Continue debugging with enhanced logging and direct MQTT testing.
