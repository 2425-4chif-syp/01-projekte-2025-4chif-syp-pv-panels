== Documentation for Connecting a Quarkus Application to an MQTT Server
_Sebastian Radic_

== Introduction

This document outlines how a Quarkus project was configured to establish a connection to an MQTT broker, receive messages from various topics, and optionally process them further.

== Configuration

The `application.properties` file contains essential settings:

- **CORS Support:** Enabled to allow requests from different origins.
- **Quarkus Build:** Configured to package the application as an "uber-jar."
- **MQTT Broker Connection:**
- Connections to multiple MQTT brokers, including configurations for host, port, username, password, topics, and QoS.
- SSL is enabled for secure communication with one broker.
- **InfluxDB Settings:**
- Includes URL, token, organization, and bucket configuration for database integration.

== MQTT Message Receiver

The `MqttReceiver` class handles incoming MQTT messages:

- **Message Handling:**
- Messages are received from specific topics (e.g., `leoenergy`, `co2`).
- Raw or structured messages are logged to the console.
- **Method Binding:**
- Methods are linked to topics defined in the configuration file.
- Differentiation between blocking and non-blocking behavior is implemented.

== Initialization Bean

The `InitBean` class is used for application startup initialization:

- **Startup Event:** The bean is activated during application startup.
- **Logging:** Logs a message to confirm the application has successfully started.
